    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This quick and easy lunch is similar to a classic chicken salad, but it's made 
        with mashed chickpeas instead. It is perfect for vegetarians and can easily be
        made vegan by swapping the mayo for a plant-based alternative.
    </p>
    <p>Packed with protein, fiber, and flavor, this salad is creamy, crunchy, and very 
        satisfying, even when you are short on time. This is a go-to in my house for meal
        prepping as it stores in the refrigerator for up to a week!
    </p>
